# Dummy
### Easy content for your mockups.
#### Users, text, and images. One line of code away. 


When you're mocking up your interface you don't want to use your time creating models, incorporating APIs, or finding placeholder data.

Dummy makes it easy to pull sample data like...

- Users - Including names, profile pictures, passwords, addresses, and more.
- Text - Get blocks of placeholder "lorem ipsum" text of varying lengths and styles.
- Media - Easily grab placeholder images and videos, either randomly or based on pre-defined search terms.

If you have needs for other data, open an issue and I'll see how I can integrate it!
